# wrt ‭topics, sources & supporting material

### replit (and markdown) vs jupyter notebooks

script migrated from colab notebooks for inclusion of languages beyond python.

## sources

topics draw heavily from tim sauers <i>‬‭numerical analysis, 2nd edition</i>‬‭. delivery itself always contains extra material, links, examples. middle and later topics are selected or reduced content‬ ‭from sauers book, which had the basic flow desired. early material and special topics are‬ ‭sourced elsewhere and noted as such.‬

## supporting material

sauers book also provides some questions (or types of questions) for longer coursework. quizzes are written and delivered weekly and mostly do not repeat between semesters as they reflect the‬ ‭needs of the current students.

most python code in this repository was written in-house – including demos and tutorials. in the very rare case it was not, its‬ ‭source is noted. python is the programming language supported by this course but coursework is accepted‬ ‭in other languages – as long it runs on replit (or matlab). fyi, the demonstrations are incomplete‬ ‭bc they are extended or completed during lecture or recitation-style office hours or in recordings.‬
