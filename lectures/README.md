# wrt ‭lectures, sources & supporting material

## colab

colab is the development environment chosen for this course and colab notebooks for lecture notes is the‬ ‭result of classroom circumstance – and student requests. back in my day </cane-shake></cane-shake> students had to take their own notes!‬

t‭he computer lab that hosts numerical methods has inaccessible whiteboards; their usable space is‬ ‭quite far off the ground. lectures started as handwritten with code walk-throughs but evolved to latex‬ ‭layered between code in colab notebooks and then to colab-generated pdfs with proofs, derivations, examples‬ ‭blocked out for handwriting via ipad. (handwriting remains an excellent speed for student digestion.) that is the‬ ‭intent of the colab notebooks.‬

## sources

t‭he notebooks draw heavily from tim sauers <i>‬‭numerical analysis, 2nd edition</i>‬‭. lecture delivery itself always contains extra material, links, examples but middle and later notebooks are selected or reduced content‬ ‭from sauers book -- which had the basic flow desired for the class. early material and special lectures are‬ ‭sourced elsewhere and noted as such.‬

## supporting material

sauers book also provides some questions (or types of questions) for longer coursework. quizzes are written and delivered weekly and mostly do not repeat between semesters as they reflect the‬ ‭needs of the current students.

most python code in this repository was written in-house – including demos and tutorials. in the very rare case it was not, its‬ ‭source is noted. python is the programming language supported by this course but coursework is accepted‬ ‭in other languages – as long it is a language supported by a stable, reputable online environment. fyi, the demonstrations are incomplete‬ ‭bc they are extended or completed during lecture or recitation-style office hours or in recordings.‬
